## About me
Iâ€™m tenacious, analytical, creative, and extremely curious about the world around me and the people in it. Iâ€™m serious about the details, but I also place high value on relationships and open communication.

I have multiple interests, and will never stop learning. This is probably why I ended up working in tech ðŸ¤“

## Research interests
I'm currently working on a final year research project focusing on Machine Learning techniques for fraud detection which is taking up the bulk of my time outside of work.

Other things I'm learning about:
- Risk analytics
- Analytics Development Lifecycle
- Technology tools and learning

## Instructional design and writing portfolio
While I no longer work full time on instructional design projects, you can see examples of my work designing learning experiences and resources in my [portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/lvdmportfolio/?usp=sharing).
