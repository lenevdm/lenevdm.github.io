## Hi, I'm Lené 👋
#### 👩‍💻 I'm a data analyst and a final year computer science student at the University of London. 

#### ⛰ I live just outside Cape Town and when not communing with machines you'll find me on a hiking path somewhere, or in the ocean.

#### 🎓 I have a Masters in Linguistics and a background in instructional design for tech companies, but I've been working in data since 2021.

#### 🛠 I'm interested in applying software engineering principles to the data world.
